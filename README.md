在数学学习过程中，发现教科书体系有许多环节是缺失的。

初中几何-代数到解析几何的飞跃太快了，到了高中大量的解析几何内容中，许多代数技巧是闻所未闻、见所未见的。导致在高中想要靠自学跟上应试进度几乎不可能。

在大学阶段，起手就是高等数学，而其中的数列或者说无穷级数问题的引入是缺失的，高等学府如清华等已经认识到无穷级数在历史上是在微积分之前的，并且认识论上也是如此。

而中国常用的大学教材会把无穷级数放到第二册的最后才讲，对认识发展的影响很大。可以说是实在论的直接结果。

鉴于此，通过探索笔卡尔在近代思想史上的工作，抓住了两个关键点“几何”和“代数”，以及它们的结果“解析几何”。同时代笛卡尔和费马分别从几何和代数方向前进，象征两个阶级达到了“解析几何”。

历史上如此，现实中我国的数学教育中几何基础也是扎实的。但是代数体系上没有一本像“几何原本”一样大全一体的成果总结型书籍来帮助人学习。

通过寻找，最终定位到欧拉晚年的这本流行于欧洲的代数学教材，应该可以作为小学高年级到初中的过渡教材，鉴于国内没有中译本，于是自己开始翻译，希望尽快将欧拉的原文翻译完。

原文本来自 z-lib，搜索"Elements of Algebra (Leonhard Euler, Scott Hecht (editor))"应该能找到。

翻译用分章分节的形式，有利于多人合作翻译，有缘人速来^\_^

## English Version

In the process of learning mathematics, I discovered that many parts of the textbook system are incomplete.

The leap from middle school geometry-algebra to analytic geometry is too fast. In high school, when analytic geometry is introduced extensively, many algebraic techniques are completely unfamiliar. This makes it almost impossible to catch up with exam preparation progress through self-study in high school.

At the university level, studies begin with advanced mathematics. However, the introduction to series or infinite series is missing. Top universities like Tsinghua have recognized that infinite series historically preceded calculus and are epistemologically prior as well.

However, commonly used university textbooks in China only introduce infinite series at the end of the second volume, which significantly impacts the development of understanding. This is a direct result of realism in educational philosophy.

In light of this, by exploring Descartes’ work in the history of modern thought, I identified two key points: “geometry” and “algebra,” as well as their result: “analytic geometry.” In the same era, Descartes and Fermat advanced from geometry and algebra respectively, symbolizing the two classes reaching “analytic geometry.”

Historically, this was the case, and in reality, the foundation of geometry in Chinese mathematics education is also solid. However, there is no comprehensive book summarizing algebraic systems, akin to “The Elements” for geometry, to assist learners.

After searching, I finally pinpointed Euler’s late work, a popular algebra textbook in Europe, which should serve as a transition textbook for late primary school to junior high school. Since there is no Chinese translation available domestically, I started self-translating it, hoping to complete Euler’s original text as soon as possible.

The original text can be found on z-lib by searching "Elements of Algebra (Leonhard Euler, Scott Hecht (editor))."

The translation is organized into chapters and sections to facilitate collaborative translation. Fellow enthusiasts, join us quickly! ^\_^
